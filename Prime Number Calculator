Define a flag variable initialized to 1, with n being a prime number by default
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer:"))
yes= 1
for i in range(2,n):
    if n%i==0:
       yes=0
       break
#Define Boolean type variables
n,it's a prime number=True
n,it isn't a prime number=False
#Output Boolean type variables
if yes:
   print(n,it's a prime number)
else:
   print(n,it isn't a prime number)
